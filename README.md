# TITANIC-MACHINE-LEARNING-FROM-DISASTER
**Titanic Survival Prediction**
This repository contains a Python script for predicting Titanic survival outcomes using the Titanic dataset. The project uses various data preprocessing techniques and machine learning algorithms to train a model that can predict whether a passenger survived or not.

Overview
The script processes the Titanic dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and training an XGBoost classifier. The model is then used to make predictions on the test dataset.

Features
Data loading and preprocessing (e.g., handling missing values, label encoding)
Model training using XGBoost classifier
Prediction on the test dataset
Results saved to a CSV file (resultfile.csv)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
cd titanic-survival-prediction
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Place the train.csv and test.csv files in the same directory as the titanic.py script.
Run the script:
bash
Copy code
python titanic.py
The script will output the predictions to a file named resultfile.csv.
Dependencies
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
xgboost
scikit-learn
tabulate
Make sure to install these packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib xgboost scikit-learn tabulate
Results
The model predictions are saved to resultfile.csv, which contains the survival predictions for each passenger in the test dataset.
